  <h3 align="center">2023 Feng Chia University Undergraduate Capston Project</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This project is motivated by the need to improve Taiwan's public safety. Despite many surveillance cameras, their low resolution hampers effective criminal identification. Inspired by recent security challenges, we aim to use our knowledge to tackle this issue.

| ![pic](Screenshot/Super Resolution.png) | ![pic](Screenshot/Pose Estimation.png) |

The primary goal of this project is to integrate facial super-resolution and facial recognition technologies, combining public security systems, area CCTV monitoring systems, and mobile apps to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of surveillance systems, and to promote crime detection and prevention. Specifically, this project aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. Facial Super-Resolution Restoration: By employing super-resolution models, this project aims to restore low-resolution images of faces captured by surveillance cameras to high-resolution images, thereby enhancing image clarity and detail.

2. Facial Recognition Technology: Utilizing deep learning algorithms, the project will develop facial recognition models to accurately identify target individuals from high-resolution images and extract their facial features.

3. Integration with Public Security and Area CCTV Monitoring Systems: By integrating public security and area CCTV monitoring systems, the project aims to achieve real-time monitoring of multiple locations.

4. Mobile App Integration: Through a mobile app, the project seeks to enable remote access to the monitoring system, providing convenient operations and viewing features.

5. Comparison with Criminal Suspect Database: By comparing facial recognition results with a criminal suspect database, the project will assist law enforcement in rapidly capturing facial information of suspects or persons of interest, thereby enhancing case investigation efficiency, preventing crimes, and curtailing the continued evasion of suspicious individuals.

The realization of this project will improve the efficiency and accuracy of surveillance systems, aiding law enforcement in better maintaining social order and public safety, and ensuring the security of people's lives and property.
